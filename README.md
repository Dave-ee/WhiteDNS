#### Mini DNS Server (Python)

A whitelisting DNS server. It only replies to domain queries that is has registered. Any other domain queries are answered with a set IP that can be changed. Useful if you want to block websites, or use the DNS server for an internal network that doesn't have access to the internet/other external networks. Also useful for pentesting.
